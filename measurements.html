						<h1 class="title">Measurements of Effectiveness</h1>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>
							TravelWare will be able to measure the effectiveness of this new Metrics Programme that is being introduced to the company.
							We believe that this metrics programme will be the stepping stone in the right direction to continually improving our software 
							development process and the time it takes for a project to be delivered to the client.
							</p>
							<p>
							I, as SQA Officer, within the company believe  that we can measure if this new programme is effective if:
							</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Make data collection easy</strong><br />
									We will be making the collection of this data as simple as possible throughout the whole team. The measurements will be built into
									the production process so that data collection does not distract from the productivity of the team.
								</li>
								<br />
								<li><strong>Communication</strong><br />
									If the goals of the metrics programme have been properly and efficiently communicated throughout the company and 
									to each employee. This will be done through circulating this internal website to each employee and by management 
									holding a meeting with employees to discuss what success looks like to get each team member on board. Overall it will
									be the test team that will be collecting and analysing the data but the management will be responsible for the effect change.
								</li>
								<br />
								<li><strong>Periodically review the measures</strong><br />
									As this is a new programme to the company, we will be review these measures on a regular basis to see if they are actually working
									well for the data that we need to get and the data that we are actually collecting. Once we find the correct measures for our company,
									these reviews will still be regular but maybe just not as often.
								</li>
								<br />
								<li><strong>Avoid changing metrics during a project</strong><br />
									While a project being undertook at our offices, we will not being changing metrics. We will assess how effective the metric worked 
									at the end of the project and change if necessary or continue using for the next project. If we were to change a metric during a project
									cycle, it would disrupt the whole team and would denigrate the overall use of metrics.
								</li>
								<br />
								<li><strong>Publicise the data and analysis</strong><br />
									When the data has been collected by the test team, this will then be made publically available throughout the whole team. This is to make
									sure that each team member is aware that the transparency of the information is critical to the success of change that results from this
									metrics programme.
								</li>
							</ul>
