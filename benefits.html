						<div class="entry">

								<ul>
									<li>Metrics provides objective information throughout the software company. This reduces the ambiguity that often surrounds complex and constrained software projects.</li>
									<li>Metrics can accurately describe the status of software project processes and products. It is key to objectively representing the progress of project activities and the quality of associated software products across the project life cycle. Metrics helps to answer questions such as “Is the project on schedule?” or “is the software ready to be delivered to the user?” </li>
									<li>Software Project Managers can use metrics as a resource to anticipate problems and to avoid being forced into a reactive, fix on fail approach.</li>
									<li>Metrics help the decision maker to assess the impacts of decisions objectively and make informed trade-off's to best meet project objectives and to optimize software project and product performance.</li>
									<li>Metrics provides an effective rationale for selecting the best alternatives. For example, the current software and IT business environments demand successful project performance. Business, technical and project managers must be able to defend the basis of their estimates and plans with historical performance data. Then, they must be able to justify changes to plans with current performance data.</li>

						<h1 class="title">Difficulties of a Metrics Programme</h1>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>People - The SQA team should convince them that data collection and its later analysis produces improvements and their personal efforts will not be measured. </li>
									<li>Integration within the organisation</li>
									<li>Cost of the metrics programme especially the start up cost of the programme</li>

						<h1 class="title">Importance of Investing in a Metrics Programme</h1>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>
									The application of metrics is focused on surpassing the continuous crisis symptoms in Software:
									<ul>
										<li>The budgets and planning forseen are surpassed(unrealistic expectations)</li>
										<li>There are important problems in reliability and quality</li>
										<li>The cost of quality is very high</li>
										<li>There are not sufficient resources</li>

							<p>
							<table>
							<td>	
								<strong>Advantages</strong><br />
								<ul>	
									<li>It can be used as a ease of maintenance metric</li>
									<li>Used as a quality metric, gives relative complexity of various designs.</li>
									<li>Measures the minimum effort and best areas of concentration for testing.</li>
									<li>It guides the testing process by limiting the program logic during development.</li>
								</ul>
							</td>	
							<td>	
								<strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
								<ul>	
									<li>The cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the program's control complexity and not the data complexity</li>
									<li>The same weight is placed on nested and non-nested loops.</li>
									<li>Deeply nested conditional structures are harder to understand than non-nested structures.</li>
									<li>It may give a misleading figure with regard to a lot of simple comparisons and decision structures.</li>

								<strong>Advantages</strong><br />
								<ul>	
									<li>Cohesiveness of methods within a class is desirable, since it promotes encapsulation</li>
									<li>Lack of cohesion implies classes should probably be split into two or more sub-classes</li>
									<li>Any measure of disparateness of methods helps identify flaws in the design of classes.</li>
								</ul>
							</td>	
							<td>	
								<strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />
								<ul>	
									<li>Low cohesion increases complexity, thereby increasing the likelihood of errors during the development process</li>
