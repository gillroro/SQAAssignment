						<div class="entry">
							<p>
							Software quality assurance can be defined as a planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that an item or product conforms to the established product requirements.
							The process involves a set of activities designed to evaluate the process by which products are developed or manufactured.
							</p>
							<p>
							I have been  appointed as the SQA Officer for TravelWare to help the company ensure that the software developed within our company is planned, designed, developed and maintained to an extremely high standard.
							</p>
							<p>
							My plans for my new appointment are:
							<ul>
								<li>Make sure the product for a client is <strong>correct</strong> and matches the requirements</li>
								<li>The <strong>maintainability or modifibility</strong> of the product can be carried out with ease</li>
								<li>The software should be <strong>portable</strong> and should be transferable to another system</li>
								<li>The system itself should be designed for easy <strong>testing</strong></li>
								<li>The <strong>usability</strong> of the software should require litte effort and it should be easy to get to know how to use it</li>
								<li>The software should be <strong>reliable</strong> and should have little to no defects within the system</li>
								<li>The application itself should be <strong>efficient</strong> and shouldn't take up too much space within the computer system and the code itself should be <strong>reusable</strong> so that it can be reused within a different context.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
