						<h1 class="title">New SQA Practice</h1>
						<div class="entry">
							<p>
								I recommend that we, at TravelWare, introduce the idea of <strong>metrics</strong> to the company. The SQA department will be making sure that this new practice is implemented within the whole company.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Metrics
								</strong>
								<br />
								A metric can be defined as a standard of measuring or evaluating something. A measure is a quantity, a proportion or a qualitative comparison of some kind. 
								There are 3 different types of metrics:
									<ol>
										<li>Informational - Will tell us what is going on</li>
										<li>Diagnostic - Will identify areas for improvement</li>
										<li>Motivational - Will influence behaviour</li>
									</ol>	
							</p>
							<p>
								Metrics have always been used to help guide managers with decisions about the organisation. Introducing metrics to TravelWare will provide the CIO, the senior management and the project managers how to effectively and efficiently manage the software development department of the company.
								Although firstly, we need to ask each other some questions. Is defect tracking necessary? Who should decide which metrics are the most useful to the company? How can a team get the most value out of its quality metrics program?
								
							</p>
							
							<p> 
								<strong>Why Metrics?</strong><br />
								Metrics or measures allow for the interpretation and analysis of data. 
								Metrics can be used to predict or estimate how long a project is going to take from start to finish. It can provide a status on a project at any time. It will also be able to tell 
								if there are any implications in the project or process. It can assess the software development process itself and metrics will also be able to tell TravelWare if it has the correct 
								staffing needs within the company.
							</p>
							<p>
								Data are the actual, factual units of information that are measured directly at some point in the process. 
								Example:
									<ul>
										<li>Units produced</li>
										<li>Lines of code in a module</li>
										<li>User Stories/Use cases</li>
										<li>Defects Found/Reported/Corrected</li>
										<li>Tests Completed/Passed</li>
									</ul>	
							</p>
							<p>	
								The key issue is to make sure that TravelWare collect accurate data. This data must be validated and verified at the point of collection. The data definitions must be precise so that we know exactly what to collect and report. 
								Imprecise data definitions can lead to useless data and it could mean wasting time that company doesn't have. The company will be able to use, display and communicate these metrics so that the employees and clients will not distrust
								how they are being used.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<strong>Primitive Metrics</strong><br />
									Primitive metrics or raw data are the best things to maintain in a historical database. They are often less biased. They can have many different uses and are typically used in many calculations for different measures. On the downside, primitive
									metrics take up a lot of storage although data reduction techniques can help.
									<br />
								<strong>Calculated Metrics</strong><br />	
									Calculated metrics are computed or calculated values that depend on data or other measures. 
									Example:
										<ul>
											<li>Defects per line of code</li>
											<li>Defects per hour of Testing</li>
											<li>Correction Time per defect</li>
											<li>Mean Time between failure</li>
										</ul>	
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>What will TravelWare not be measuring?</strong><br />
								The SQA department at TravelWare will be not measuring a few different areas of data. 
								We will not be measuring the productivity or performance of each individual. If we were to do this, it would cause people to generate invalid numbers and it can 
								easily penalise that most valuable contributors to each project. Instead, we will be putting the focus on the process. This will allow us to measure the product and
								the information to help improve the process and it will help us measure people by their mature and effective use of a process to help improve overall results.
